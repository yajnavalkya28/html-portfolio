<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Maddi Yajnavalkya N V S S, a passionate and curious Computer Science Engineering student at VIT-AP. I enjoy exploring core technical areas like AI/ML, Web Development and embedded systems, and I'm always looking for ways to apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems. I believe in blending creativity with technology to make meaningful projects.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on various innovative ideas, including a smart shoe for women's safety and a mobile app-based art marketplace called Cre8ive Bazzar, which connects artists and customers through buying, gifting, and auction features. I also enjoy developing software systems like library management tools, and experimenting with neural networks and transfer learning for tasks like toxic comment classification.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I actively participate in tech clubs, contribute to team projects, and enjoy taking on responsibilities that help me grow. Whether it's app development, electronics, or research-based work, I’m always eager to learn, build, and make a positive impact through technology.</p>
